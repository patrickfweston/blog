&lt;p&gt;This week, I took a trip to Boston for work. Flight prices were cheaper to return on Sunday rather than Friday or Saturday, so I decided to make a trip out out of it. I also have a life goal of visiting all 50 U.S. States, and I was missing Vermont. I figured if I were that close I should take advantage of the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;boston&#34;&gt;Boston&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in Boston from Wednesday through Friday, and I caught the string of extremely warm February weather. It was in the high 60s and low 70s for all three days I was there. I went on a beautiful morning run on Thursday in 50+ degree weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.patrickfweston.com/imgs/boston.jpg&#34; class=&#34;blog__image--center&#34; alt=&#34;Views from my morning run in Boston&#34; /&gt;
&lt;small class=&#39;center caption&#39;&gt;Views from my morning run in Boston&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been to Boston three times before, but each time I&amp;rsquo;m back, I&amp;rsquo;m captivated by the sheer amount of history you can discover. Taking a stroll through downtown you stumble upon 200+ year old buildings and sites of the American Revolution. On Friday, I created my own 13 mile walking tour. I strolled from Cambridge to Faneuil Hall to the Back Bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.patrickfweston.com/imgs/boston-route.png&#34; class=&#34;blog__image--center&#34; alt=&#34;Part of the 13 miles of walking I did in Boston on Friday&#34; /&gt;
&lt;small class=&#39;center caption&#39;&gt;Part of the 13 miles of walking I did in Boston on Friday&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highlight was crossing the Harvard Bridge at night&amp;mdash;you can stand in the middle of the Cambridge River and get views from all around Boston. I&amp;rsquo;d post a picture, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think the ones I took even come close enough to do it justice. If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing I recommend doing in Boston, it&amp;rsquo;s this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.patrickfweston.com/imgs/mit.jpg&#34; class=&#34;blog__image--center&#34; alt=&#34;The Gates Tower as part of the computer science building on MIT&#39;s campus in Cambridge.&#34; /&gt;
&lt;small class=&#39;center caption&#39;&gt;The Gates Tower as part of the computer science building on MIT&amp;rsquo;s campus in Cambridge&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-hampshire&#34;&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early Saturday morning, I rented a car and headed for Montréal in Quebec, Canada. Along the way, I stopped in Concord, New Hampshire to get a look at their state capitol (I&amp;rsquo;m also a political nerd). I had gotten up at 5:45am and was extremely hungry. I found a cute little bakery across the street called The Crust and Crumb Baking Co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.patrickfweston.com/imgs/scone.jpg&#34; class=&#34;blog__image--center&#34; alt=&#34;My delicious blueberry scone with the New Hampshire capitol in the background.&#34; /&gt;
&lt;small class=&#39;center caption&#39;&gt;My delicious blueberry scone with the New Hampshire capitol in the background.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was one of my favorite aspects of this trip: being able to wander around, taking my time getting to destinations. If I saw a side street that looked interesting, I turned down it and rerouted. I was nice to just explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;montréal&#34;&gt;Montréal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there I continued on to Canada. Crossing the border was surprisingly uneventful and simple. I pulled up, presented my (newly obtained) passport, answered a few questions and then kept on driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew Quebec was a mainly French speaking province of Canada, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize how immediate the French would be. Initially, there were no signs of any English road signs. You can discern the meaning of words based on their context and their similarity to the English equivalent. Luckily, through Sprint I had 1 GB of data to use while in Canada, so Google Maps continued to function (I had downloaded some of the maps just in case there was a snafu). Once I got closer to Montréal, signs started to appear in English and French.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.patrickfweston.com/imgs/sign.jpg&#34; class=&#34;blog__image--center&#34; alt=&#34;A typical road sign in Montréal&#34; /&gt;
&lt;small class=&#39;center caption&#39;&gt;A typical road sign in Montréal&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things I did in Montréal was visiting Mont Royal. It&amp;rsquo;s a large hill that provides amazing views of downtown Montréal and the St. Lawrence River. I hiked up through the snow and ice. I about fell a few times, but I made it to the top and FaceTimed my mom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.patrickfweston.com/imgs/mont-royal.jpg&#34; class=&#34;blog__image--center&#34; alt=&#34;The amazing view as seen from Mont Royal.&#34; /&gt;
&lt;small class=&#39;center caption&#39;&gt;The amazing view as seen from Mont Royal&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was having a great day. But then the rain struck. We&amp;rsquo;re not talking about a light drizzle. It was a full on downpour. I knew I only had 6 hours or so in the city, so I decided to suck it up: I zipped up my coat, put my hood up and trekked through the rain. By the end of the day, I was completely soaked through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then walked through Old Montréal. It&amp;rsquo;s what I picture Europe to be like. It was a series of old, crooked, cobblestone-lined streets with small shops and restaurants located along the way. In the neighborhood is the Basilique Notre-Dame de Montréal, a historic Catholic basilica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.patrickfweston.com/imgs/notre-dame.jpg&#34; class=&#34;blog__image--center&#34; alt=&#34;A rainy shot of the Basilique Notre-Dame de Montréal.&#34; /&gt;
&lt;small class=&#39;center caption&#39;&gt;A rainy shot of the Basilique Notre-Dame de Montréal&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last stop in Montréal was to visit the Mile End neighborhood. It had been recommended online and by some folks who had visited Montréal before. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know this about me, I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of public rapid transit systems. Even though it was raining&amp;mdash;or really pouring buckets&amp;mdash;and I had a car, to get to Mile End, I decided to take the Montréal Metro. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train was unlike any other I had seen before. All of the cars were connected, so you could freely travel throughout the entire length of the train. There were also large video screens indicating your progress. What I most appreciated from the experience was the sheer exposure to how bilingual Montréal was. There were pockets of people speaking English, French and what I presume to be Mandarin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was on the train for about a station and a half when I realized that the overhead speaker was providing instructions purely in French. I also realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know how many stops I had to go, etc. I quickly pulled out my phone and found my way. It felt oddly eerie hearing the practically computerized voice give instructions that I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;video src=&#34;http://blog.patrickfweston.com/imgs/metro.mp4&#34; autoplay loop class=&#34;blog__image--center&#34; alt=&#34;A Montréal Metro train approaching the station.&#34; /&gt;
&lt;small class=&#39;center caption&#39;&gt;A Montréal Metro train approaching the station&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made my way to the restaurant and back. When I exited the station and started walking to my car, I experienced my first Franglish conversation. A Montréaler, about my age, approached me and presumably asked if I knew where a certain street was. Rather than getting nervous and speaking English right away, I said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Désolé, je ne comprends pas le français&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;(or &amp;ldquo;Sorry, I don&amp;rsquo;t understand French)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received a confused look. I think I blended in just enough to trick him into think I was from the area. He switched to English and asked me where a street was. I replied that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t from Montréal, handed him my phone and let him look around on Google Maps. He was extremely thankful, as was I to not fulfill the stereotype of the fumbling American tourist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;vermont&#34;&gt;Vermont&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that exchange, I jumped in my car and headed for Burlington, Vermont where I would spend the night and a little bit of the morning. I woke up the next day to a 27ºF windy day. I first walked to Lake Champlain. It&amp;rsquo;s a much larger lake than I realized, appearing almost as a coast of an ocean rather than a lake. There are beautiful rolling hills in the background. I can only imagine how nice it would be in the summertime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.patrickfweston.com/imgs/lake.jpg&#34; class=&#34;blog__image--center&#34; alt=&#34;My view of beautiful Lake Champlain&#34; /&gt;
&lt;small class=&#39;center caption&#39;&gt;My view of beautiful Lake Champlain&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then spent the next 3 hours eating my way through Vermont. I stopped by the Penny Cluse Cafe. I was told it was a popular spot among locals, but I was a little surprised to see a line out the door at 8am. In half an hour, I knew why. I got buckwheat pancakes with pure Vermont maple syrup. That&amp;rsquo;s hard to beat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then bought a doughnut (as a gift for Katie, the doughnut lover), some maple syrup for my father and stopped by the Ben &amp;amp; Jerry&amp;rsquo;s factory to get myself a fresh scoop of Cherry Garcia. Needless to say, I skipped lunch that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.patrickfweston.com/imgs/ice-cream.jpg&#34; class=&#34;blog__image--center&#34; alt=&#34;A scoop of Cherry Garcia at 11am. Other people were eating ice cream then, too so you can&#39;t judge me.&#34; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;homeward-bound&#34;&gt;Homeward Bound&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started the drive back to Boston to catch my return flight and stopped by Montpelier, Vermont to take a peek at the Vermont State House (remember, I&amp;rsquo;m a political nerd 🤓).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.patrickfweston.com/imgs/vt-state-house.jpg&#34; class=&#34;blog__image--center&#34; alt=&#34;The State House in Montpelier, Vermont&#34; /&gt;
&lt;small class=&#39;center caption&#39;&gt;The State House in Montpelier, Vermont&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I booked my flight a few weeks ago, I noticed I could upgrade to first class. I decided to go for it since the airfare was mainly covered through work. I just paid the upgrade fee myself. At this point, I was getting pretty exhausted from waking up early, walking around (I average 9.8 miles a day) and driving. Flying first class turned out to be just what I needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received warmed nuts with my drink (ginger ale and Tito&amp;rsquo;s vodka). My meal consisted of a salad, filet with asparagus and quinoa, roll and warm chocolate chip cookie. The seats were large, and my 6&amp;rsquo;3&amp;rdquo; self could cross my legs with no problem. For years I&amp;rsquo;ve squished into my seat, but I could finally stretch out. There were large touch screen displays, and I tracked my flight while we were in the air instead of watching a movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.patrickfweston.com/imgs/first-class.jpg&#34; class=&#34;blog__image--center&#34; alt=&#34;I had to squeeze an awkward selfie in. Here I am with my ginger ale and vodka&#34; /&gt;
&lt;small class=&#39;center caption&#39;&gt;I had to squeeze an awkward selfie in. Here I am with my ginger ale and vodka.&lt;br /&gt;Yes this was #2. Yes they were strong.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to accomplish some New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions, and I got one state closer to reaching my goal of visiting all 50 U.S. States. I also learned a lot throughout my trip. Traveling by yourself can seem daunting or lonely, but I actually appreciated the time for introspection. I&amp;rsquo;m also normally a strong planner&amp;mdash;I like to know when I&amp;rsquo;m visiting what&amp;mdash;but this time I allowed for more exploration. I turned down interesting streets even if it added time to my trip. I made a spur of the moment decision to drive by Dartmouth College just because I wanted to. It was good to remember that not everything has to be planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.patrickfweston.com/imgs/states.png&#34; class=&#34;blog__image--center&#34; alt=&#34;Map of the U.S. States I&#39;ve been to thus far&#34; /&gt;
&lt;small class=&#39;center caption&#39;&gt;Map of the U.S. States I&amp;rsquo;ve been to thus far&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a realization of how difficult it must be for individuals to move and not know the native tongue of their new country. I need to exhibit an increased patience when I encounter an immigrant, tourist or individual that doesn&amp;rsquo;t speak English. I was in a largely bilingual city, and even then I felt confused or embarrassed at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I let myself have a little fun. I&amp;rsquo;m normally very frugal and would roll my eyes at the people flying in first class. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve consistently ordered water at restaurants for the past 15 years of my life (Sprite used to be my go-to). Instead, I ordered what I wanted, and I splurged to fly in first. These aren&amp;rsquo;t things I will do again soon, but it was nice to take myself on vacation. Hopefully you can too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Virtual Bake Sale</title>
      <link>http://blog.patrickfweston.com/post/virtual-bake-sale/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2017 21:49:46 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.patrickfweston.com/post/virtual-bake-sale/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My coworker is helping to sponsor a refugee family of 9 through an organization called &lt;a href=&#34;http://nooneleft.org/&#34;&gt;No One Left Behind&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No One Left Behind supports wartime allies (interpreters, soldiers, cultural advisors, and other allies of American troops) who have been displaced from their home due to their association and support to Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The family has been in Chicago for a year. The father supports the family of 9 on one salary, but he has been unemployed for the last two months. Given this, the family is behind on their rent and needs financial help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how you feel about recent changes to immigration, this is something we can definitely all get behind&amp;mdash;helping out a family in need that put their lives on the line helping American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help spur things along, I&amp;rsquo;m offering to send you a batch of fresh baked goods if you donate at least $25 by Saturday at midnight. If you can&amp;rsquo;t make a donation of that size, I&amp;rsquo;ll instead post a funny selfie following your artistic direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.patrickfweston.com/imgs/proof.jpg&#34; class=&#34;blog__image--center&#34; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a reputation for creating some pretty tasty baked goods. You&amp;rsquo;ll get to pick from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckeye_candy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Buckeyes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brownies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.patrickfweston.com/imgs/the-goods.jpg&#34; class=&#34;blog__image--center&#34; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have any trouble, just shoot me an email, Tweet at me, or message me through Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for helping to make a difference!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>We Are All Humans</title>
      <link>http://blog.patrickfweston.com/post/we-are-all-humans/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2015 20:11:46 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.patrickfweston.com/post/we-are-all-humans/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who knows me fairly well knows that I&amp;rsquo;m Catholic. To some though, the subject may never come up or we never get a chance to know each other close enough for it to be revealed. I keep things pretty under wraps publicly&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m not afraid to share my faith, but I want to do it in a way that is organic. St. Francis of Assisi sums up my philosophy best:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preach the Gospel at all times and when necessary use words&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the recent events in the world&amp;ndash;of terrorism, destruction, senseless killing, and mass exodus&amp;ndash;I decided I no longer could keep silent. It was time for words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like everyone else, as I heard the news of the terrorism in France, I was rattled. Human suffering pulls heavily on our hearts, and I found myself moved with compassion for the French people. Their strife occupied my mind. In addition, I thought that France wasn&amp;rsquo;t too much different than the United States. This type of attack could happen where I live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is shameful, however, was my own lack of knowledge and caring about the terrorist attacks that had happened in Beirut just a day before. As of last report, 43 people were killed with 239 people suffering injuries. The attacks contained stories of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/16/middleeast/lebanon-adel-termos-beirut-hero/index.html&#34;&gt;heroism&lt;/a&gt; and of heartbreak. I could easily blame my lack of understanding on a lack of reporting by the media, but I was struck with the realization that my heart didn&amp;rsquo;t move in the same way. Sure I felt saddened. Sure I said a prayer for the people in the area. The longing, the sense of pain wasn&amp;rsquo;t the same. And I&amp;rsquo;m ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.patrickfweston.com/imgs/lebanon.jpg&#34; class=&#34;blog__image--center&#34; /&gt;
&lt;small class=&#39;center caption&#39;&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/world/middleeast/beirut-lebanon-attacks-paris.html?_r=0&#34;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These people suffered violence from the same terror group that caused destruction in France. In fact, Lebanon has been overrun with refugees and has experienced violence in the past. I should&amp;rsquo;ve felt compassion for the Lebanese people long before this attack even took place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am embarrassed to say that I suffered (and will likely continue to suffer) from &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups#Outgroup_derogation&#34;&gt;outgroup derogation&lt;/a&gt;: I showed preference to the attack of Paris because of a certain affinity I share with the French people, largely because we&amp;rsquo;re two Western countries. I would suspect many others in the United States felt the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar group effects have now caused for an unfortunate string of events where a link has been made to the refugee crisis in the Middle East. Scrolling through my Facebook feed, I ran across countless posts celebrating United States governors who are denying Syrian refugees in their state. I see people calling Muslims terrorists. I see people sharing statements by Donald Trump that he&amp;rsquo;d close down mosques. Even more frustrating, is that these sentiments are often echoed from people who identify as Christian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.patrickfweston.com/imgs/states.jpg&#34; class=&#34;blog__image--center&#34; /&gt;
&lt;small class=&#39;center caption&#39;&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cnni/status/666470568263352320?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet&#34;&gt;CNN International&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While an extremely small percentage of Muslims are terrorists, does that make all Muslims terrorists? &lt;em&gt;In other words, because there were a small number of Catholic priests who were child molesters, does that make me a child molester?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muslims in the Middle East are fleeing their hometowns and traveling expansive distances just to have a door slammed in their face. They face persecution from extremists within their own religion. And they are scorned by the West for belonging to a religion with extremists. They have no options, no one to take them in. These refugees are people. They&amp;rsquo;re fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters. They love each other, they are kind. I would even venture to say that they show more religious tolerance than many Christians in America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why are we acting so openly rude and uncompassionate to these individuals who need our help?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What happened to the American values of justice and liberty?&lt;/em&gt; Our country was founded, molded and shaped by individuals who saw America as a land of opportunity. We welcomed the lost and the oppressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What happened to the Christian ideas of helping your neighbor?&lt;/em&gt; Mary and Joesph were Middle Eastern refugees looking for somewhere to stay when Jesus was born. In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Good_Samaritan&#34;&gt;parable of the Good Samaritan&lt;/a&gt;, the traveller&amp;ndash;who was a Jew&amp;ndash;was passed by two others only to be rescued by a Samaritan, a group of individuals who hated Jews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These refugees and Muslims all over the world are in need of help. Scripture mentions many times that we should help our brothers and sisters in need: &amp;ldquo;Whoever has two tunics is to share with him who has none, and whoever has food is to do likewise. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+3:10-11&#34;&gt;Luke 3:10-11&lt;/a&gt;)&amp;rdquo; There is no qualifier; we don&amp;rsquo;t just help other Christians, we help all who need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completely agree that safety is a concern, and I&amp;rsquo;m a supporter of background checks and other measures to ensure the United States remains safe. What I do not support is hatred and bigotry of Muslims. I do not support denying a safe place to live to someone just because they&amp;rsquo;re from Syria. In addition, our current &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/xenophobia&#34;&gt;xenophobia&lt;/a&gt; is likely &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/16/the-islamic-state-wants-you-to-hate-refugees/?postshare=3061447696150758&amp;amp;tid=ss_tw&#34;&gt;exactly what ISIS was hoping for&lt;/a&gt;. Peaceful, everyday Muslims are facing an increasingly hostile America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the saying goes, &amp;ldquo;it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.&amp;rdquo; But we&amp;rsquo;re blowing out all of the candles. We&amp;rsquo;re fighting darkness with darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a matter of happenstance, I ran across a poem and an excerpt is quite fitting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give me your tired, your poor,&lt;br /&gt;
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,&lt;br /&gt;
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.&lt;br /&gt;
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,&lt;br /&gt;
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of you may know that &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Colossus&#34;&gt;these words&lt;/a&gt; appear on the base of the Statue of Liberty, a gift from France to the United States. These values that we share with France are fundamental to who we are as a nation and as a world. They describe the American dream that is not just for the select few, but for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us not succumb to fear but instead choose to love, for Scripture says that &amp;ldquo;perfect love casts out all fear (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4:18&#34;&gt;1 John 4:18&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;rdquo; We can take action far beyond changing our profile picture on Facebook: be tolerant, be accepting, be ready to help. Feel compassion for our brothers and sisters all over this world, regardless of race or creed. Let our light shine brightly (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:14-16&#34;&gt;Matthew 5:14-16&lt;/a&gt;) as an example of what the world should be.&lt;/p&gt;
