		This week, I took a trip to Boston for work. Flight prices were cheaper to return on Sunday rather than Friday or Saturday, so I decided to make a trip out out of it. I also have a life goal of visiting all 50 U.S. States, and I was missing Vermont. I figured if I were that close I should take advantage of the opportunity.

		My coworker is helping to sponsor a refugee family of 9 through an organization called No One Left Behind.
 No One Left Behind supports wartime allies (interpreters, soldiers, cultural advisors, and other allies of American troops) who have been displaced from their home due to their association and support to Americans.
 The family has been in Chicago for a year. The father supports the family of 9 on one salary, but he has been unemployed for the last two months.
