      <description>If you’re a regular follower of my content on Instagram, you know that I have traveled quite a bit this year. I’ve headed to all corners of the US: Boston, Vermont and Montreal; Florida; Texas, Arizona and New Mexico; Yellowstone, Portland, Seattle and Vancouver. I absolutely love to travel and to see how other people live, but I wanted to clear up the reason of why I’ve traveled so much this year.</description>

      <description>This week, I took a trip to Boston for work. Flight prices were cheaper to return on Sunday rather than Friday or Saturday, so I decided to make a trip out out of it. I also have a life goal of visiting all 50 U.S. States, and I was missing Vermont. I figured if I were that close I should take advantage of the opportunity.
Boston I was in Boston from Wednesday through Friday, and I caught the string of extremely warm February weather.</description>
