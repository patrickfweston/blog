      <description>The past year and a half has been a particular interesting one for me. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of fun, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also done a million ordinary things. It’s easy with social media to dwell on the highlights, but I want to talk about the difficult times too.
I know it may be hard to spot with my smiley veneer, but for the past few years of my life I’ve had spouts of depression.</description>

      <description>This has been a pretty crazy year for me. If you would&amp;rsquo;ve asked me at the start of this year if I could see myself traveling as much as I have, I definitely would&amp;rsquo;ve said no. I&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled in to some great opportunities to explore the United States and the rest of the world, and I find myself stumbling into yet another one.
For the next 5 weeks, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be traveling throughout Asia.</description>

      <description>According to my mom, I was a big baby when I was born. I clocked in at about 9 pounds…and I was 4 weeks early. From birth to about age 15, I was definitely on the bigger side. I was never too overweight, but let’s just say that when I went back to school shopping for a new pair of jeans they had to be a “husky” fit. Because of my larger than normal size, I grew to be very self conscious of my weight and self-appearance.</description>

      <description>If you’re a regular follower of my content on Instagram, you know that I have traveled quite a bit this year. I’ve headed to all corners of the US: Boston, Vermont and Montreal; Florida; Texas, Arizona and New Mexico; Yellowstone, Portland, Seattle and Vancouver. I absolutely love to travel and to see how other people live, but I wanted to clear up the reason of why I’ve traveled so much this year.</description>
