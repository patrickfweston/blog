      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who knows me fairly well knows that I&amp;rsquo;m Catholic. To some though, the subject may never come up or we never get a chance to know each other close enough for it to be revealed. I keep things pretty under wraps publicly&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m not afraid to share my faith, but I want to do it in a way that is organic. St. Francis of Assisi sums up my philosophy best:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preach the Gospel at all times and when necessary use words&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the recent events in the world&amp;ndash;of terrorism, destruction, senseless killing, and mass exodus&amp;ndash;I decided I no longer could keep silent. It was time for words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like everyone else, as I heard the news of the terrorism in France, I was rattled. Human suffering pulls heavily on our hearts, and I found myself moved with compassion for the French people. Their strife occupied my mind. In addition, I thought that France wasn&amp;rsquo;t too much different than the United States. This type of attack could happen where I live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is shameful, however, was my own lack of knowledge and caring about the terrorist attacks that had happened in Beirut just a day before. As of last report, 43 people were killed with 239 people suffering injuries. The attacks contained stories of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/16/middleeast/lebanon-adel-termos-beirut-hero/index.html&#34;&gt;heroism&lt;/a&gt; and of heartbreak. I could easily blame my lack of understanding on a lack of reporting by the media, but I was struck with the realization that my heart didn&amp;rsquo;t move in the same way. Sure I felt saddened. Sure I said a prayer for the people in the area. The longing, the sense of pain wasn&amp;rsquo;t the same. And I&amp;rsquo;m ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.patrickfweston.com/imgs/lebanon.jpg&#34; class=&#34;blog__image--center&#34; /&gt;
&lt;small class=&#39;center caption&#39;&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/world/middleeast/beirut-lebanon-attacks-paris.html?_r=0&#34;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These people suffered violence from the same terror group that caused destruction in France. In fact, Lebanon has been overrun with refugees and has experienced violence in the past. I should&amp;rsquo;ve felt compassion for the Lebanese people long before this attack even took place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am embarrassed to say that I suffered (and will likely continue to suffer) from &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups#Outgroup_derogation&#34;&gt;outgroup derogation&lt;/a&gt;: I showed preference to the attack of Paris because of a certain affinity I share with the French people, largely because we&amp;rsquo;re two Western countries. I would suspect many others in the United States felt the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar group effects have now caused for an unfortunate string of events where a link has been made to the refugee crisis in the Middle East. Scrolling through my Facebook feed, I ran across countless posts celebrating United States governors who are denying Syrian refugees in their state. I see people calling Muslims terrorists. I see people sharing statements by Donald Trump that he&amp;rsquo;d close down mosques. Even more frustrating, is that these sentiments are often echoed from people who identify as Christian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.patrickfweston.com/imgs/states.jpg&#34; class=&#34;blog__image--center&#34; /&gt;
&lt;small class=&#39;center caption&#39;&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cnni/status/666470568263352320?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet&#34;&gt;CNN International&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While an extremely small percentage of Muslims are terrorists, does that make all Muslims terrorists? &lt;em&gt;In other words, because there were a small number of Catholic priests who were child molesters, does that make me a child molester?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muslims in the Middle East are fleeing their hometowns and traveling expansive distances just to have a door slammed in their face. They face persecution from extremists within their own religion. And they are scorned by the West for belonging to a religion with extremists. They have no options, no one to take them in. These refugees are people. They&amp;rsquo;re fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters. They love each other, they are kind. I would even venture to say that they show more religious tolerance than many Christians in America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why are we acting so openly rude and uncompassionate to these individuals who need our help?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What happened to the American values of justice and liberty?&lt;/em&gt; Our country was founded, molded and shaped by individuals who saw America as a land of opportunity. We welcomed the lost and the oppressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What happened to the Christian ideas of helping your neighbor?&lt;/em&gt; Mary and Joesph were Middle Eastern refugees looking for somewhere to stay when Jesus was born. In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Good_Samaritan&#34;&gt;parable of the Good Samaritan&lt;/a&gt;, the traveller&amp;ndash;who was a Jew&amp;ndash;was passed by two others only to be rescued by a Samaritan, a group of individuals who hated Jews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These refugees and Muslims all over the world are in need of help. Scripture mentions many times that we should help our brothers and sisters in need: &amp;ldquo;Whoever has two tunics is to share with him who has none, and whoever has food is to do likewise. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+3:10-11&#34;&gt;Luke 3:10-11&lt;/a&gt;)&amp;rdquo; There is no qualifier; we don&amp;rsquo;t just help other Christians, we help all who need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completely agree that safety is a concern, and I&amp;rsquo;m a supporter of background checks and other measures to ensure the United States remains safe. What I do not support is hatred and bigotry of Muslims. I do not support denying a safe place to live to someone just because they&amp;rsquo;re from Syria. In addition, our current &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/xenophobia&#34;&gt;xenophobia&lt;/a&gt; is likely &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/16/the-islamic-state-wants-you-to-hate-refugees/?postshare=3061447696150758&amp;amp;tid=ss_tw&#34;&gt;exactly what ISIS was hoping for&lt;/a&gt;. Peaceful, everyday Muslims are facing an increasingly hostile America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the saying goes, &amp;ldquo;it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.&amp;rdquo; But we&amp;rsquo;re blowing out all of the candles. We&amp;rsquo;re fighting darkness with darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a matter of happenstance, I ran across a poem and an excerpt is quite fitting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give me your tired, your poor,&lt;br /&gt;
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,&lt;br /&gt;
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.&lt;br /&gt;
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,&lt;br /&gt;
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of you may know that &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Colossus&#34;&gt;these words&lt;/a&gt; appear on the base of the Statue of Liberty, a gift from France to the United States. These values that we share with France are fundamental to who we are as a nation and as a world. They describe the American dream that is not just for the select few, but for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us not succumb to fear but instead choose to love, for Scripture says that &amp;ldquo;perfect love casts out all fear (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4:18&#34;&gt;1 John 4:18&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;rdquo; We can take action far beyond changing our profile picture on Facebook: be tolerant, be accepting, be ready to help. Feel compassion for our brothers and sisters all over this world, regardless of race or creed. Let our light shine brightly (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:14-16&#34;&gt;Matthew 5:14-16&lt;/a&gt;) as an example of what the world should be.&lt;/p&gt;
