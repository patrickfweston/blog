        <p class="lede">Thoughts on the current world situation: on terrorism, religion, mass exodus and tolerance.</p>

        <p>Anyone who knows me fairly well knows that I&rsquo;m Catholic. To some though, the subject may never come up or we never get a chance to know each other close enough for it to be revealed. I keep things pretty under wraps publicly&ndash;I&rsquo;m not afraid to share my faith, but I want to do it in a way that is organic. St. Francis of Assisi sums up my philosophy best:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Preach the Gospel at all times and when necessary use words.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In light of the recent events in the world&ndash;of terrorism, destruction, senseless killing, and mass exodus&ndash;I decided I no longer could keep silent. It was time for words.</p>

<p>Like everyone else, as I heard the news of the terrorism in France, I was rattled. Human suffering pulls heavily on our hearts, and I found myself moved with compassion for the French people. Their strife occupied my mind. In addition, I thought that France wasn&rsquo;t too much different than the United States. This type of attack could happen where I live.</p>

<p>What is shameful, however, was my own lack of knowledge and caring about the terrorist attacks that had happened in Beirut just a day before. As of last report, 43 people were killed with 239 people suffering injuries. The attacks contained stories of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/16/middleeast/lebanon-adel-termos-beirut-hero/index.html">heroism</a> and of heartbreak. I could easily blame my lack of understanding on a lack of reporting by the media, but I was struck with the realization that my heart didn&rsquo;t move in the same way. Sure I felt saddened. Sure I said a prayer for the people in the area. The longing, the sense of pain wasn&rsquo;t the same. And I&rsquo;m ashamed.</p>

<small class='center caption'>From <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/world/middleeast/beirut-lebanon-attacks-paris.html?_r=0">The New York Times</a></small></p>

<p>These people suffered violence from the same terror group that caused destruction in France. In fact, Lebanon has been overrun with refugees and has experienced violence in the past. I should&rsquo;ve felt compassion for the Lebanese people long before this attack even took place.</p>

<p>I am embarrassed to say that I suffered (and will likely continue to suffer) from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups#Outgroup_derogation">outgroup derogation</a>: I showed preference to the attack of Paris because of a certain affinity I share with the French people, largely because we&rsquo;re two Western countries. I would suspect many others in the United States felt the same.</p>

<p>Similar group effects have now caused for an unfortunate string of events where a link has been made to the refugee crisis in the Middle East. Scrolling through my Facebook feed, I ran across countless posts celebrating United States governors who are denying Syrian refugees in their state. I see people calling Muslims terrorists. I see people sharing statements by Donald Trump that he&rsquo;d close down mosques. Even more frustrating, is that these sentiments are often echoed from people who identify as Christian.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/states.jpg" class="blog__image--center" />
<small class='center caption'>From <a href="https://twitter.com/cnni/status/666470568263352320?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">CNN International</a></small></p>

<p>While an extremely small percentage of Muslims are terrorists, does that make all Muslims terrorists? <em>In other words, because there were a small number of Catholic priests who were child molesters, does that make me a child molester?</em></p>

<p>Muslims in the Middle East are fleeing their hometowns and traveling expansive distances just to have a door slammed in their face. They face persecution from extremists within their own religion. And they are scorned by the West for belonging to a religion with extremists. They have no options, no one to take them in. These refugees are people. They&rsquo;re fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters. They love each other, they are kind. I would even venture to say that they show more religious tolerance than many Christians in America.</p>

<p><em>Why are we acting so openly rude and uncompassionate to these individuals who need our help?</em></p>

<p><em>What happened to the American values of justice and liberty?</em> Our country was founded, molded and shaped by individuals who saw America as a land of opportunity. We welcomed the lost and the oppressed.</p>

<p><em>What happened to the Christian ideas of helping your neighbor?</em> Mary and Joesph were Middle Eastern refugees looking for somewhere to stay when Jesus was born. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Good_Samaritan">parable of the Good Samaritan</a>, the traveller&ndash;who was a Jew&ndash;was passed by two others only to be rescued by a Samaritan, a group of individuals who hated Jews.</p>

<p>These refugees and Muslims all over the world are in need of help. Scripture mentions many times that we should help our brothers and sisters in need: &ldquo;Whoever has two tunics is to share with him who has none, and whoever has food is to do likewise. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+3:10-11">Luke 3:10-11</a>)&rdquo; There is no qualifier; we don&rsquo;t just help other Christians, we help all who need it.</p>

<p>I completely agree that safety is a concern, and I&rsquo;m a supporter of background checks and other measures to ensure the United States remains safe. What I do not support is hatred and bigotry of Muslims. I do not support denying a safe place to live to someone just because they&rsquo;re from Syria. In addition, our current <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/xenophobia">xenophobia</a> is likely <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/16/the-islamic-state-wants-you-to-hate-refugees/?postshare=3061447696150758&amp;tid=ss_tw">exactly what ISIS was hoping for</a>. Peaceful, everyday Muslims are facing an increasingly hostile America.</p>

<p>As the saying goes, &ldquo;it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.&rdquo; But we&rsquo;re blowing out all of the candles. We&rsquo;re fighting darkness with darkness.</p>

<p>In a matter of happenstance, I ran across a poem and an excerpt is quite fitting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Give me your tired, your poor,<br />
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,<br />
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.<br />
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,<br />
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many of you may know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Colossus">these words</a> appear on the base of the Statue of Liberty, a gift from France to the United States. These values that we share with France are fundamental to who we are as a nation and as a world. They describe the American dream that is not just for the select few, but for all.</p>

<p>Let us not succumb to fear but instead choose to love, for Scripture says that &ldquo;perfect love casts out all fear (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4:18">1 John 4:18</a>).&rdquo; We can take action far beyond changing our profile picture on Facebook: be tolerant, be accepting, be ready to help. Feel compassion for our brothers and sisters all over this world, regardless of race or creed. Let our light shine brightly (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:14-16">Matthew 5:14-16</a>) as an example of what the world should be.</p>
