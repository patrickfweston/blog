		The past year and a half has been a particular interesting one for me. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun, but I&rsquo;ve also done a million ordinary things. It’s easy with social media to dwell on the highlights, but I want to talk about the difficult times too.
I know it may be hard to spot with my smiley veneer, but for the past few years of my life I’ve had spouts of depression.

		This has been a pretty crazy year for me. If you would&rsquo;ve asked me at the start of this year if I could see myself traveling as much as I have, I definitely would&rsquo;ve said no. I&rsquo;ve stumbled in to some great opportunities to explore the United States and the rest of the world, and I find myself stumbling into yet another one.
For the next 5 weeks, I&rsquo;m going to be traveling throughout Asia.

		According to my mom, I was a big baby when I was born. I clocked in at about 9 pounds…and I was 4 weeks early. From birth to about age 15, I was definitely on the bigger side. I was never too overweight, but let’s just say that when I went back to school shopping for a new pair of jeans they had to be a “husky” fit. Because of my larger than normal size, I grew to be very self conscious of my weight and self-appearance.

		If you’re a regular follower of my content on Instagram, you know that I have traveled quite a bit this year. I’ve headed to all corners of the US: Boston, Vermont and Montreal; Florida; Texas, Arizona and New Mexico; Yellowstone, Portland, Seattle and Vancouver. I absolutely love to travel and to see how other people live, but I wanted to clear up the reason of why I’ve traveled so much this year.

		Growing up, roadtrips were a common occurrence. Now, I know what you&rsquo;re picturing: the whole family hopping in the car during the summer and making the drive to Florida. We absolutely did that. But we also traveled throughout the year across the Midwest and the rest of the US.
There were two reasons for this:
 My brother played on a travel basketball team My dad regularly brought the whole family along to conferences he had to attend.

		This week, I took a trip to Boston for work. Flight prices were cheaper to return on Sunday rather than Friday or Saturday, so I decided to make a trip out out of it. I also have a life goal of visiting all 50 U.S. States, and I was missing Vermont. I figured if I were that close I should take advantage of the opportunity.
Boston I was in Boston from Wednesday through Friday, and I caught the string of extremely warm February weather.

		Update: Y&rsquo;all. We were able to raise $425 for this family. Thank you for your support and for showing the big-heartedness of Americans.
 My coworker is helping to sponsor a refugee family of 9 through an organization called No One Left Behind.
 No One Left Behind supports wartime allies (interpreters, soldiers, cultural advisors, and other allies of American troops) who have been displaced from their home due to their association and support to Americans.

		Anyone who knows me fairly well knows that I&rsquo;m Catholic. To some though, the subject may never come up or we never get a chance to know each other close enough for it to be revealed. I keep things pretty under wraps publicly&ndash;I&rsquo;m not afraid to share my faith, but I want to do it in a way that is organic. St. Francis of Assisi sums up my philosophy best:
