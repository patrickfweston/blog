        <p class="lede">Traveling is a hobby for me, but it&#39;s also turned into much more than that. It&#39;s been a great way for me to get through things in the last few months.</p>

        <p>If youâ€™re a regular follower of my content on Instagram, you know that I have traveled quite a bit this year. Iâ€™ve headed to all corners of the US: Boston, <a href="/post/traveling-with-yourself">Vermont and Montreal</a>; Florida; Texas, Arizona and New Mexico; Yellowstone, Portland, Seattle and Vancouver. I absolutely love to travel and to see how other people live, but I wanted to clear up the reason of <em>why</em> Iâ€™ve traveled so much this year. I feel I owe it to everyone to be honest and not to sugarcoat things.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s easy on social media to show the world only the good stuff. Iâ€™m definitely guilty of this. It just doesnâ€™t make sense for me to post a picture when Iâ€™m having a bad day; nobody wants to see a photo of me being grumpy. I recently got back from a trip to Fargo, North Dakota and Minneapolis, Minnesota. It was a really great trip in helping me get my mind in a good place, so I thought I&rsquo;d share some things.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/fargo.jpg" class="blog__image--center" alt="The Fargo Theatre in downtown Fargo, North Dakota. I saw my first movie by myself: The Big Sick." />

<p>There are a myriad of reasons for why Iâ€™ve traveled so much this year. Iâ€™ve gone on a few trips for work, Iâ€™ve gone on some just for fun and others have fulfilled <a href="/post/race-fifty-states">long-time travel dreams that Iâ€™ve had</a>.</p>

<p>But the real reason that Iâ€™ve been traveling so much is because Iâ€™ve had a lot going on in my personal life. To be completely honest, these past couple of months have been some of the most difficult of my life. Theyâ€™ve been painful, confusing and lonely.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been using travel as a way to escape the day-to-day realities that Iâ€™ve been facing. Itâ€™s been a way to change the scenery and to attempt to clear my headspace. Thereâ€™s something about driving a rental car through a new land by myself with the radio on or a podcast playing that just seems to sooth my soul. The just-beginning-to-change leaves on my drive helped me realize how things start and stop, die and grow.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/fall.jpg" class="blog__image--center" alt="The leaves were just beginning to change in western Minnesota along I-94." />

<p>Iâ€™m not too sure how healthy of a habit this is (it&rsquo;s a tad expensive ðŸ˜‚), but itâ€™s been helpful for me so far. Itâ€™s always hard to come back to reality at the end of a trip, but Iâ€™ve always found myself returning with increased optimism and new insights into life.</p>

<p>Some of the most recent <em>#RoadTripWisdom</em> Iâ€™ve discovered:</p>

<ul>
<li>We are all unique. The role we play in this world is special and only we can fulfill it. There is a place for all of us. Everyone matters. I matter.</li>
<li>While weâ€™re all unique, we share common experiences with other humans. We all have people we love, we all get happy and sad, we all fight daily battles. It&rsquo;s ok to not be ok.</li>
<li>People, at their core, are overwhelming good.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/imgs/chicago-sunrise.jpg" class="blog__image--center" alt="I started the trip with a literal sunrise. And I ended it with a figurative one in my life." />
<small class='center caption'>I started the trip with a literal sunrise, and I ended it with a figurative sunrise in my life.</small></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been in some not-so-great places mentally these past few months. It&rsquo;s been a real struggle to do both the big and the little things each day. These trips have provided me some light at the end of the tunnel &ndash; they&rsquo;ve been something to look forward. And even more so than that, they&rsquo;ve helped me cope with the struggles of life.</p>

<p>On the road I&rsquo;ve had a lot of moments of personal clarity. A long flight that most people would be upset about has been a therapy session. Each mile on the road has been distance traveled toward a better me. Each meal Iâ€™ve eaten alone has been food for growth.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve got a few more trips planned for this year&hellip;letâ€™s see where I end up.</p>
